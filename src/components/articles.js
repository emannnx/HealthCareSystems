      <h2>What is Hypertension?</h2>
      <p>Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a common condition where the force of blood against your artery walls is consistently too high. Over time, this can cause health problems like heart disease.</p>
      
      <h2>Symptoms of Hypertension</h2>
      <p>Most people with hypertension don't experience symptoms, which is why it's often called the "silent killer." Some may experience:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Headaches</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath</li>
        <li>Nosebleeds</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Risk Factors</h2>
      <p>Several factors increase your risk of developing hypertension:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Age: Risk increases as you get older</li>
        <li>Family history: Hypertension tends to run in families</li>
        <li>Obesity: Being overweight or obese increases your risk</li>
        <li>Sedentary lifestyle: Physical inactivity</li>
        <li>Tobacco use: Smoking or chewing tobacco</li>
        <li>High sodium diet: Too much salt can raise blood pressure</li>
        <li>Excessive alcohol consumption</li>
        <li>Stress: High levels of stress can temporarily increase blood pressure</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Management Strategies</h2>
      <p>Lifestyle changes can help manage hypertension:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Regular physical activity</li>
        <li>Maintaining a healthy weight</li>

        <li>Limiting alcohol consumption</li>
        <li>Reducing stress</li>
        <li>Taking prescribed medications consistently</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>When to See a Doctor</h2>
      <p>Regular blood pressure screenings are essential. If you haven't had yours checked recently, schedule an appointment with your healthcare provider. If you're already taking medication for hypertension, regular follow-ups are important to ensure your treatment plan is working effectively.</p>
